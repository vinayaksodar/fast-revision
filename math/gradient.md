# Gradient

Gradient appears in multivariable calculus i.e the dependent variable is a function of more than one independent variable.

Gradient will give the direction of the greatest change of function i.e normal to a level surface of that function passing through that point.

**Note:** Don't get confused as it is made up of derivatives as derivatives represted tangent slope in single variable calculus remember the gradient is not a derivative it is a direction.

Gradient is derived from the directional derivative. That is how you know it is the direction of greatest change
